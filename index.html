      <p>Dots and boxes is a two player game in which each player take turns drawing lines between the dots on the game board either horizontally or vertically. The player who draws the last line on a 1x1 box wins the box and thus also earns a point. This continues until the whole grid is full, in this case all 25 boxes are taken, and no more lines can be drawn. The player with the most boxes at the end of the game wins.</p>
