#####Challenges :

The main issues I had with this project was with the functionality of the game: the boxes and getting them to register that all adjacent lines had been clicked. 
Tried different methods, nothing's stuck so far. one of them came pretty close but it was targeted at a specific box and because of the loops I used it would just keep searching when I used console.log()

*please see code for reference.

Going to keep working on it, code on github should be the current code. I'll try to update code and Readme as frequently as possible.

#####Take-Aways :

So far I'm enjoying the challenge. It can be quite frustrating at times but it wouldn't be a challenge if it wasn't, smooth seas don't make good sailors. It's highlighted some issues I should work on improving moving forward.
